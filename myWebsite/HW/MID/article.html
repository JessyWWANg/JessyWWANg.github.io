    <div class="box">"It first became apparent to my parents that something was wrong when I was four or five months old. I began chewing on my tongue while teething. They took me to a paediatrician where I underwent a series of tests. At first they put a cigarette lighter underneath my foot and waited for my skin to blister. Once they saw that I had no response to that then they began running needles up and down my spine. And since I had no response to either of those tests they came to the conclusion that I had what I have - congenital analgesia. By which point, I had chewed off about a quarter of my tongue through teething."<br><br>--Steve Pete</div>

    <div class="box">The chief symptom of hyperalgesia is an increasingly extreme reaction to <inv>pain</inv>ful stimuli without any new injuries or worsening of a medical condition. An example would be a surgical incision that becomes more <inv>pain</inv>ful over time, yet the wound is not infected, and a person has not experienced any further injury.<br><br>--<i>Hyperalgesia: What you need to know</i></div>

    <div class="box">"We got a ton of ideas of people who have gone through it," said Brown. "And let me tell you, they have been a gift to us." One crucial idea was developing ways to "teach" Isaac to recognize <inv><a href="index3.html">pain</a></inv> and possible injuries. "We're doing the best we can to just teach him; he knows blood is bad," said Brown. "We taught him even when he was little to say 'ow.' You don't have to tell normal kids to say 'ow.'"<br><br>--mother of Isaac Brown</div>

    <div class="box">Pit Bulls have the same nervous system of any other breed, and they can and do feel <inv>pain</inv>. Historically, those dogs that would tolerate or ignore discomfort and <inv>pain</inv> and finish the task they were required to perform were the dogs that were bred and the sort of dogs breeders strove to produce. This is the trait of gameness that so many breed fanciers speak of, which may be defined as, The desire to continue on and/or complete a task despite <inv>pain</inv> and discomfort.<br><br>--<i>Pit Bull Facts & Myths</i></div>

    <div class="box">Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a weakening of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber, usually as the result of severe emotional or physical stress, such as a sudden illness, the loss of a loved one, a serious accident, or a natural disaster such as an earthquake. (For additional examples, see "Stressors associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.") That's why the condition is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or broken-heart syndrome. The main symptoms are chest <inv>pain</a></inv> and shortness of breath.<br><br>--<i>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken-heart syndrome)</i></div>
