    <h2>Changes made to homepage</h2>
    <p>This is a screenshot of the homepage. There used used to three buttons leading to the three main pages. People suggests that the process of going forward and backward is messy so I made the storyline linear. Thus the three button are placed on separated pages. It does seems clearer to go through the process. People says the pictures are too abstract but i don't want to remake them so I just made them bigger to be recognized.</p>

    <h2>Changes made to interactive functions</h2>
    <p>This is the page listing out the “categories of pain”. I was playing with the audio and at first I made each circle leading to a playing sound clip. It’s somehow boring to listening to something on a blank page so I gathered all clips on the same page. Each clicking will trigger a playing sound clip so the player is able to hear a symphony containing painful elements. This might made the website approaching a sound project.</p>

    <h2>Changes made to the article page</h2>
    <p>The hover function is mostly used in my website. And for this page full of articles I referenced, people suggest me to add the name of who shared this experience so it calls out the relation between the player and the experiencers. Also people suggest me to make more clickable/hoverable items(there was only one) so I made all the “pain” words hoverable to get a glowing effect and one of them is a clickable button leading to the next page.</p>
