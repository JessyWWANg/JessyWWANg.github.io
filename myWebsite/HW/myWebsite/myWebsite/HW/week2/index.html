  <p style="color:#FFF2F2">The two articles are not talking about the same thing but very related in a way. <I>Long Live the Web</I> discusses how the platform of information, the web, should establish rules to keep itself inclusive to all users, in order for “the whole human being” to share information. It’s a great action of synchronization of knowledge in human society. <I>As We May Think</I> discusses the science development of coding system to record, which is different from what humans’ brains work thus become necessary aid for people to enter the ideal realm of open information as mentioned in <I>Long Live the Web</I>. </p>

  <p style="color:#FFF2F2">The internet’s feature of connection enables people to interact in a very efficient way while having no restriction of distance(language might be an obstacle when complicated ideas are involved), and this freedom is like a free market, where people have fair competitions. Yet sometimes it’s hard to say if people’s choices in this market is made by their own. A rich company could invest more money into advertising, in such ways making consumers immerse in the sense of their products being popular. After all, the internet is a market run by capitals, it brings freedom as well as false appearance.</p>
