		<p>John Berger conveys an idea that there‚Äôre basically 3 ways still paintings could be manipulated as technology develops to improve the mobility of seeing a painting: by adding visual/audio/texts elements. He mentions the virgin of the rocks, which in fact, one of the 2 versions of this painting was found out to have a different original draft beneath it by infrared light examination. This background story is definitely extra information which will, according to Berger, manipulate how audience see this painting. This is an action of adding sequential guidance of appreciating a painting. The manipulation is subconscious but worth considering as it turns a painting consisting of ‚Äúpixels‚Äù or ‚Äúbrushstrokes‚Äù into one of objects full of meanings and even another layer underneath.

    <p>It‚Äôs interesting to see that, at the end of the video, Berger foretells the appearance of social media which contains interactions, offering mobilities in ways of seeing(and communicating). The existence of social media has already brought huge manipulation to every piece of artwork and push it away from the origin.

    <p>To conclude, I agree with his theory of technology bringing manipulation to an original piece(specifically a still painting of tranquility), thus it would be necessary to learn to filter information we receive. On the other hand, since it‚Äôs an inevitable trend for people to add extra information to things going through media, it‚Äôs actually a good way to produce nice works without necessarily being experts in certain fields; so for those who want to advertise their works could probably take the chance to utilize the artificial way of ‚Äúseeing‚Äù and make art pieces in an industrialized way.
