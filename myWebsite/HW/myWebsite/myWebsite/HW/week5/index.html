    I uploaded several photos to the ImageNet Roulette, and found two of them pretty interesting. This is my dad and he is a drinker, according to the AI.

    This is a sheep, and AI does think it’s a sheep. It seems biased when looking at human’s photos but relatively objective examine non-human creatures. It’s interesting to me getting the comparative results.</p>


    <p>
    AI are not living things thus people might consider them as “not biased”, but the truth is, AI learns everything from the database given by synthesized human knowledge. That is, people teach AI to be biased. It’s funny and hilarious at the beginning, and then the article points out that things could get serious, when AI reveals and reflects the discrimination on gender, races, …all “unprivileged groups” among a variety of identity. The article mentions a concept of people being “processed” and “categorized” as data and aggregated to form a database. It’s a new way to treat each individual’s characteristics in an inorganic way, but getting a biased, organic result. This action is very meaningful in revealing the essence of society, culture, …anything establishing the interactions and relations between human being.</p>
