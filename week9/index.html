Web 2.0 is a platform of data(information) flow, and the amazingly increased speed as well as amount of exchangeable information is what the number 2.0 stands for. Internet users are placed in a much more open world, and with the accessibility comes troubles. While people are entering a frequently updating virtual system of large amount of information, they might be not aware of the potential troubles and loopholes appearing in unfamiliar forms. People usually don’t have vigilance of their surroundings on the internet due to the invisibility of danger. Also the exchange of information allows and encourages people to meet each other online which brought up conversations about to what extent could people believe who they meet online. Some enjoys the friendship and profits brought by “tribal bond” and some suffer from the relationship made online. The virtual world is affecting what’s in the reality.
