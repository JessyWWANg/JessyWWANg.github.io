  <p class="va">
  <br>
  <r>Pain</r> has an element of blank
  <br>
  It cannot <r>recollect</r>
  <br>
  When it began, or if there were
  <br>
  A day when it was not
  <br>
  It has no future but itself
  <br>
  Its <r>infinite</r> realms contain
  <br>
  Its past, <r>enlightened</r> to perceive
  <br>
  New periods of <r>pain</r>
